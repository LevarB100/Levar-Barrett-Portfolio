        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          This app is to showcase my ability to use initial HTML and CSS methods
          of webpage design. The use of HTML tags such as paragragh tags, header
          tags and CSS styling commands such as "float-left" , "margin" and
          "padding" to style the page are required.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The purpose of the app is to highlight my ability to use HTML and CSS
          styling procedures. I used a basic understanding of how the dynamics
          of HTML and CSS design can be performed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          At the end of this assignment I designed a single web page that
          consist of multiple blocks laid out on a single background. I used a
          configuration of blocks centered on the webpage and arranged in a
          specific pattern that required the use of specific HTML and CSS
          methods to achieve.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          The main challenge of this project was to properly align the blocks
          centered in the middle of the page. Understanding the dynamics of
          things such as the margin, padding and border of a div item on a page
          is also a challenge when designing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would like to make next time is the time I took to
          complete this assignment. I would also like to vary the color of the
          page as well.
