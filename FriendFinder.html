        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          This app involved building a simulated dating application. The user
          would answer survey questions and the application would you an array
          of the numerical values assoiciated with each question to pair the
          User with the most compatible dater in the database.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The motivation of the assignment is to make an application that used
          math and JQuery methods to perform a certain objective. Although this
          assignment was fictional, the logic was a simple exposure to
          algorithms that can be used in coding to make a decision.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          At the end of this assignment the I have designed a application that
          makes a simple dicision using mathematic and simple algorithm
          principles. After completion have a basic idea of how basic JQuery and
          algorithms can achieve the objective of an application.
        </p>

        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of this assignment was to build the logic.
          The syntax was somewhat difficult . However, I was most challenged by
          the logic needed to make the application perform as it should.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would like to make on a similar project like this one
          might be to increase the size of the database. I would also like to
          make the application more sensitive to the user's input, thus
          improving the selection process.
