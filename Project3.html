        <h8>App Description</h8>
        <p>
          This application is a MERN stack development aimed at people who like
          to perform conservational efforts to improve the environment. The
          application uses MERN stack, MONGO db to obtain and record the user's
          conservationist efforts and display their efforts in a form that is
          relatable to our enviroment and fun to consider.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The motivation behind this application was to make a platform that
          would influence average people to find the fun in finding
          opportunities to protect our environment. I feel this application will
          make the act of conserving fun and competitive for the users and thus
          improve our environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          The results achieved is an app that is light and friendly. The initial
          page requires the user to log into an existing account or create an
          account. Once the user logs in they are taken to the main page which
          will reflect their current total conservational efforts in the 4 main
          fields. The user will then go to the create data page to input data.
          They will either be establishing data or adding to existing data. The
          application uses calculations and the users input to convert the
          user's efforts into a form that is relatable and then display it on
          the user's main page.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Team Efforts</h8>
        <p>
          This application was completed entirely by myself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          My main challenge during the production of this application was
          performing the calculations and research needed to make sure the
          conversion of the user's input were correct in it's reflection.
          Reaserch had to be done to calculate how much the material wasted
          affected our environment and in what form.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would have made to this app was to try and make the
          code more streamlined. I would also like to add a database of the
          conversion rates rather than functions that calculate. Eventually with
          the added database the app will be able to store more calcualtions
          pertaining to more environmental waste such as platic or paper bags,
          straws and even food.I would also like to make the application capable
          of supporting groups of people who want to directly compete against
          eachother towards an amount or time restricted goal.
