        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          This app involved building a web scraping application. The applicaton
          was designed to scrape the articles from the web page (yahoo.com in
          this example) of your choice and then deposit them into a database to
          be referenced within the application.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The motivation of the app is to make an application that displays my
          ability to use CHEERIO, EXPRESS servers, AXIOS, MONGO and MONGOOSE
          within very complexed code. This app allows the user to to be able to
          access content from another website without actually going that site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          At the end of this app the I designed a application that scrapes a
          webpage and uses sequelize, mongodb and other tools to display the
          content on another site.
        </p>

        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of this assignment was to build the logic.
          The syntax was somewhat difficult . However, the challenge of making
          the logic needed to make the application automatically log into yahoo
          and automatically look for and scrape material from the site, I
          enjoyed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would like to make on a similar app like this one
          might be to increase the amount of webpages I actually scrape so I can
          increase and vary the content I can make available to the user.
