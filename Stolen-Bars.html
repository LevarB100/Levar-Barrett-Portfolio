        <h8>Project Description</h8>
        <p>
          This assignment involved building a web scraping application. The
          applicaton was designed to scrape the articles from the web page of
          your choice and then deposit them inta a database to be refrenced
          ithin the application.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Motivation</h8>
        <p>
          The motivation of the assignment is to make an application that could
          accumale articles from other webpages. This allows the user to to be
          able to access content from another website without actually going
          that site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Results</h8>
        <p>
          At the end of this assignment the student will have designed a
          application that scrapes a webpage and uses sequelize, mongodb and
          other tools to display the content on another site.
        </p>

        <h8>Challenges of the Project</h8>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of this assignment was to build the logic.
          The syntax was somewhat difficult . However, I was most challenge e
          the logic needed to make the application perform as it should.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h8>Improvements</h8>
        <p>
          An improvement I would like to make on a similar project like this one
          might be to increase the amount of webpages I actually scrape so I can
          increase and vary the content I can make available to the user.
