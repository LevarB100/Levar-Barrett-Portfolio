          <P>
            An accomplished Industrial Engineer with a plethora of successful
            projects under his belt, I have decided to take my skills into a new
            field. As a person passionate about end results and showing value
            add in everything I do, I am confident in my skills and my ability
            to stand out amongst the field. I graduated Southern Polytechnic
            State University in 2007 with a degree in Industrial Engineering. My
            first position out of college was an a Process Engineer for
            Stratasystems Inc. I worked there to establish quality management
            systems and protocol. I established multiple cost saving and process
            improvement initiative and even built an OSHA approved gantry crane.
            My next position was as an Engineering auditor for ManTech
            corporation. This role saw me move to Washington D.C and work within
            one of the largest DOJ contractors in the country. My keen eye for
            process planning and control helped my see process metric data that
            improved overall project metrics and productivity. Now I've decided
            to take my drive for perfection and creativity and put them together
            in the field of software development and coding. A hobby that has
            for a long time been a source of fun and creative outlet, I look to
            be a force creativity and excellence!!
